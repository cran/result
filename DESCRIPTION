Description: Allows wrapping values in success() and failure() types to capture 
    the result of operations, along with any status codes. Risky expressions can be 
    wrapped in as_result() and functions wrapped in result() to catch errors
    and assign the relevant result types. Monadic functions can be bound together 
    as pipelines or transaction scripts using then_try(), to gracefully handle 
    errors at any step.
